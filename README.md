Fatal police shootings are more prevalent in the United States than the rest of the developed world. The Washington Post discovered in 2015 that the FBI records of police shootings were missing 50% of the total shootings deaths at the hands of police. In response, they created their own database from reporting and public records requests. 
Their methodology can be found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-the-washington-post-is-examining-police-shootings-in-the-united-states/2016/07/07/d9c52238-43ad-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html

Along with this data, I incorporated city and state population data from the United States Census for each year from 2015-2021, but used the 2020 populations for calculations and 2020 demographic breakdowns.

In this analysis, I sought to answer some important questions. --

Where do most fatal police shootings occur?
Which cities and states have the highest number of deaths? 
How do these counts compare to the state populations? 

How does race, age, and perceived mental health status impact shooting risk?
Is any race over or underrepresented compared to its demographic proportions in the United States?
Are there any patterns in shootings where the victim was armed or unarmed?

How did police shooting fatalities change over time?
How do yearly totals compare?
Is the race makeup changing over time or remaining constant?
Is body camera usage improving over time?
Is there a time of year where more or less police shootings occur?

The Washington Post Police Shooting database is being continually updated, as roughly 1000 (give or take) Americans die in police shootings each year. I plan to continue to update my visualizations in tandem.
